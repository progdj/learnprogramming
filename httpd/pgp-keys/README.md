PGP Public File Import Folder
-----------------------------


Place all your pgp files here. Please ensure that the files end with `.asc`.

Keep in mind that you need to place the keys [here](https://github.com/VRSMedia/amak-docker/tree/develop/server/jenkins-slave/httpd/pgp-keys) too, if you would like to use them on non local containers.

To export a public key in expect format simply use `gpg --armor --export`.
